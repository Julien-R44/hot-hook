### Patch Changes

- fa6ed2e: This PR adds a new way of configuring hot-hook. This allows you to configure hot-hook without having to modify your codebase.

  We introduce a new `hot-hook/register` entrypoint that can be used with Node.JS's `--import` flag. By using this method, the Hot Hook hook will be loaded at application startup without you needing to use `hot.init` in your codebase. It can be used as follows:

  ```bash
  node --import=hot-hook/register ./src/index.js
  ```

  Be careful if you also use a loader to transpile to TS (`ts-node` or `tsx`), hot-hook must be placed in the second position, after the TS loader :

  ```bash
  node --import=tsx --import=hot-hook/register ./src/index.ts
  ```

  To configure boundaries and other files, you'll need to use your application's `package.json` file, in the `hot-hook` key. For example:

  ```jsonc
  // package.json
  {
    "hotHook": {
      "boundaries": ["./src/controllers/**/*.tsx"],
    },
  }
  ```
